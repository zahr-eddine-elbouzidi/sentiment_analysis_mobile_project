## Project name : Twitter Sentiments Analysis and Classification - Model implementation in an Android mobile application

### Description  :

The objective of our project is to carry out an exploratory and visual analysis of tweets in language
French present in our dataset.
In a second step, the goal will be to succeed in classifying using available artificial models in Python, the sentiments of tweets depending on whether they are mostly positive or negative. In other words, bring together sentiment analysis and NLP in Deep neural network.
The predictions of this RNN model will be applied in an android mobile application in order to mix between deep learning and mobile application engineering.
We will start with cleaning up tweets as text using preprocessing,
enter them into a classifying LSTM model and activate with the sigmoid function.
This classifier produces predictions on the class (Positive or Negative) to which the tweet.
